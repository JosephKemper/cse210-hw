<p>Thoughts on Encapsulation</p>
<p></p>
<p>
As I write this, my grade in my class CSE210 Programming with Classes, sits at a B-. And while grades do not always properly reflect what someone learned, in my case, I know that there is a lot I did not learn, and even more that I want to master. From the many tutorials I have seen online detailing various aspects of programming, it seems that many of the best programmers write their programs using the principles this class has focused on. It also seems that these principles are some of the things that employers are going to value the most, as why else would so many interviews have things like whiteboard coding interviews, a practice which shows how skilled a candidate is with at least a few of the principles of programming with classes. So, even if the understanding I have of these principles is worthy of more than a B-, at a minimum, I need to get better at demonstrating what I have learned, and in reality, I think it is more likely that I just need to learn more.

As I reviewed the lesson on Encapsulation, I initially did not have anything that stuck out to me as something I needed to get better at. I did find the slow evolution of the UML diagrams they showed us between the lesson on Encapsulation and the lesson on abstraction interesting, but nothing enough to write something substantial on. Then I got to the summary of all they were trying to share, and found what I was missing. The four principles of object oriented programming, are a lot more interconnected than I thought they were. Deep down inside I knew they were all interconnected, but I never really put any real thought into just how interconnected the 4 principles are. The statement that really stood out to me was the last two sentences of the summary which read: "Practice encapsulation diligently and your abstractions will become more refined, your objects more purposeful, and your classes more understandable. Continue to work at it, and over time, your programs will be vastly more flexible and easy to change."

Everything in those two sentences are things that I want to learn to master, and more importantly, they are things I want to learn to be able to demonstrate and teach others how to use. If I am to achieve my goal of becoming a leader in a software development company, then I need to epitomize all of those attributes.
