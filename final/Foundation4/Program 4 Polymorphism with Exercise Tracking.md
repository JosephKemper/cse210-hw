<p>Thoughts on Polymorphism</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The summary of the lesson on Polymorphism starts off with the following statement. "Polymorphism is the fourth and crowning principle of programming with classes. Skillful use of abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance are all required to apply polymorphism effectively. The result is a simple but powerful mechanism for ensuring that programs are flexible and ready for change."

I read that a few weeks ago, when we first started our unit on polymorphism, but I did not fully appreciate it then. I don't yet have a lot to say on polymorphism, but I can say that I appreciate these ideas a lot more. More importantly, I find my mind racing thinking about its applications, which means that now, as I proceed forward to my final, if I properly dive in, then I will be able expand out my thoughts to a much more usable and beneficial place relating to the principles of object oriented programming.
