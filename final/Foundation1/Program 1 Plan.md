Program 1: Plan
Program Purpose
Track YouTube videos and the comments left on them. 
Notes
Will store Video info in Text file. Will have two different Separators. One (currently thinking |||) will separate the different videos and their respective data from each other, the other (currently thinking ||) will separate the data about each video from the other data about the video. Upon loading the program, it will automatically load a file with the proper name and will split the videos and their data up and then will make a second split and then attach the appropriate video info to its respective variables.
