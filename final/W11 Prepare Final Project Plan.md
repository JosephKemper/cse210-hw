<p>Final Project Plan</p>
<p></p>
<p>For my final project, I am going to complete the Foundation 4 version of the assignment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Program 1: Abstraction with YouTube Videos</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The goal of this program is to organize and store data about thousands of YouTube Videos. While I only need to work with 3 or 4, it should be built with the idea of endless expansion of its data in mind, and store all the needed data about the videos in a maintainable format.
