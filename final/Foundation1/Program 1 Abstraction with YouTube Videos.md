<p>Thoughts on Abstraction</p>
<p>
This semester has been a challenging one for me on several levels, largely because of the personal issues I have had to deal with outside of my studies. And because I have struggled to grasp the foundational principles of programming with classes as thoroughly as I would like to have, in preparation for my final, I am going back through the preparation material to dive in deeper in hopes of finding some of what I missed. 
</p>
<p>
The first thing I noticed going back through the study materials is the introduction to UML design which they gave us, or at least an incredibly basic version of it. When I first saw the diagram in the "Intro to UML.JPG" file, I really did not understand what it was trying to teach us. Now, that I have tried to make several proper UML diagrams of classes, I see a powerful lesson I had missed about the nature of classes. 
</p>
<p>
The first thing I see is something that was repeated a lot by the professor throughout the semester and that is a class is an object, that is what it should be built around. Then, to look at the second line, "Responsibility" I see why you as a programmer needs to take the time to program that object in the first place, an object should do something, it should have a responsibility. I learned many lessons about the behaviors (methods) and the state (member variables), but I think the reason I struggled as much as I did on the principle of abstraction was because I did not stop to truly think about what the responsibility of the class was. In too many cases, I think that classes were just a way to split up my code into different files. So, if I am to do well on my final, then I need to make sure that I truly think of a class as an object, that behaves in needed ways and storing needed data to perform those methods, in different member variables. 
</p>
<p>
More importantly, truly following this idea of treating a class as an object, that is being created to fulfill a responsibility, it will let me start to master the principle of Abstraction, for once I have figured out the responsibility of the class, I can then ask a critical question that is needed to master the art of abstraction. "What is actually needed in this class to perform its responsibility?" Or to put it another way, "What is the least I need to put into this class, to let me use it to accomplish my goals?" Knowing my tendency to complicate things, I will likely need to stop to ask some version of either of those two questions a few times before I can get the class to just its truly needed bits.
