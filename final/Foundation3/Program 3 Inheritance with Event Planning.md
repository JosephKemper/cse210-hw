<p>Thoughts on Inheritance</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Now that I review inheritance, I think the thing I struggled with most on my last program was that the list I was working with should have been protected not private, and then perhaps I would not have ended up with different instances of the same list forming. I have noticed that C# seems to have a lot of little quirks to how it works and I think that working with inheritance is one of those things that I need to learn a lot more about in how C# behaves in certain circumstances. Another thing I need to get a lot better with is working with constructors. I can see how inheritance uses encapsulation, which means that all four of the principles of object oriented programming build upon each other. That is something I missed before.

Thinking about my last program, I think I needed one of two things, to have made the list protected and then access it directly from each of the sub-classes, or somehow use constructors and polymorphism to access the list properly. Either way, I am happy I am going back through these lessons. I am learning a lot.
