<p>Version Control</p>
<p></p>
<p>Version control is a way to keep track of changes overtime in code. On a large project (especially one that is actively being used by customers) this would be critical because it would let you roll back to a prior version if a bug is introduced, while you figure out what the bug is and how to fix it, thus allowing your users to continue using their program while you fix the otherwise crippling bug. On a personal level, I have found that stopping to properly use version control (i.e. stopping to sync changes regularly to the repository) helps me become a better coder because when I stop to sync my code, I also stop to test my code and so despite taking time away from coding, I find it easier to troubleshoot because I am frequently checking my code for quality. In VS Code, version control is extremely easy, after you have connected your work to a GitHub repository, you can use the terminal and simply type “git add .” to find all files that have been changed, then “git commit -m” plus a status message in quotes to get all the changes ready to be pushed to GitHub, and finally “git push” to sync them to GitHub. And if you do that enough, VS Code will start to predict what you are going to type which can speed you up even more. </p>
