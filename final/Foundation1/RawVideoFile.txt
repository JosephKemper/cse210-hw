Then you come along and made me understand it in less than 15 minutes. Thanks, you just earned yourself a sub!||34L H445||You lay it out so simple and clearly, damn I just love you!||Povilas Čiplis||Mike is sooo good at explaining||Varracosta||I'm so glad that I found your C# course! I tried few courses but it was so tough to understand. You have a great explanation, it's so simple and understandable. Thank you!|||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7aWkjH3UUI||C# Constructors Tutorial | Mosh||Programming with Mosh||23:23||Drabantor Greyhound||Clear voice, clear audio quality, good display resolution and last but not least good content presented in a pedagogical way, thanks!Leuk||This was very smooth and easy to follow, thank you!


For those not using ReSharper when making a new class do not add a namespace and if it has one remove it or your class will not work!||Sunova||This was very helpful! Especially how you go thru the examples step by step. But furthermore, you provide best practice too.  Superb!|||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8&t=67s||C# Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners||freeCodeCamp.org||4:31:08||DATOneDoctor-Archives||The fact that this man spent 4 hours teaching code and doesn’t add ads so we the viewers could learn.  Mad respect my man.||Annelies van Hagen||Finally found someone who doesn’t skip steps explaining, so even people like me not knowing anything about programming can follow. Thank you Mike||Pain1272||Only 1 hour in and I’m learning so much better than any teacher in school I’ve ever had… you break this down into such an easier way of understanding it||Marko Obradovic||I'm a beginner and I've always had a problem understanding classes and objects for some reason. After watching this whole course I feel like I understood more than for the past 2 months of fax + home learning,  now it all makes perfect sense in my head and I want to thank you.
Edit: After 4 hours of pure enjoyment and understanding, I felt emotional when the video ended lol|||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2SPg6IuT3k||6: How To Create Classes And Objects In C# | C# Tutorial For Beginners | C Sharp Tutorial||Dani Krossing||15:58||Alexandru Necula||I want to thank you very much. Today i got hired as a junior web developer and that's because I watched your PHP tutorials (that's more popular in my area). You made me follow my dreams, you're the best!||Cody Doss||I can honestly say I got more from this video than I have gotten from a semester and a half of school so far!!!! Thank you so much for the clear explanations. I am pretty sure I am going to be watching all of your C# and Unity video.||Waqas Mahmood||I love your way of explanation. You are my kind of teacher who explains basic and doesn't assume that others will pick up the complex concepts easily.
When I first listened to you, I thought you must be Danish (Your English accent). Now, I have checked your About which confirms that you are indeed Danish.
