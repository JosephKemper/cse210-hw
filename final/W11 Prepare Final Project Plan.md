<p>Final Project Plan</p>
<p></p>
<p>For my final project, I am going to complete the Foundation 4 version of the assignment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Program 1: Abstraction with YouTube Videos</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The goal of this program is to organize and store data about thousands of YouTube Videos. While I only need to work with 3 or 4, it should be built with the idea of endless expansion of its data in mind, and store all the needed data about the videos in a maintainable format. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Program 2: Encapsulation with Online Ordering</p>
<p></p>
<p>
This program will effectively act as a simplified order tracking system for a company. It will help track if the order is being shipped within the United States or not, format addresses for labels, track and store information about customers, track information about products, and put all of that together in the form of an order properly totaled including the cost of shipping costs. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Program 3: Inheritance with Event Planning</p>
<p></p>
<p>
This program will generate the announcements for three different kinds of events, and will customize each announcement based on the event type using the principles of inheritance. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Program 4: Polymorphism with Exercise Tracking</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    This program, will allow users to track data about their exercises and calculate stats from that data to help them see their progress in their chosen exercises.
